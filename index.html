                My Dearest Axam ❤️<br><br>
                I wanted to build something that could hold even a fraction of how much you mean to me❤️😌.<br>
                Since we met you’ve been my favorite person. They say the best things in life aren't things, they’re people. But in our case, the best thing in my life started with a notification.<br><br>
                I know we’re separated by so many miles and different time zones, but when I’m talking to you, none of that seems to matter. You’ve managed to become the most important part of my day without even being in the same room. You make me feel more seen than anyone I’ve ever met in person❤️.<br><br>
                Thank you for choosing me every day, despite the distance. 💗<br>
                There are miles between us, different streets outside our windows, and maybe even different weather in our skies, but when I close my eyes and hear your voice, all of that disappears❤️. You aren't just a name on a screen, you are my best friend, my biggest supporter, and the person I look for the second I wake up.❤️<br><br>
                I love the way we can talk for hours about everything and nothing, and how you know exactly how to comfort me without even being able to hold my hand.💗❤️<br>
                Distance is just a test to see how far love can travel, and I think we’re winning. Thank you for being my person.❤️<br>
                And I am counting, counting down the clicks until we’re finally together in person.💗<br>
                They say you can't find everything you’re looking for on the internet, but I’m pretty sure I proved them wrong the day I met you.❤️<br><br>
                I never expected that a screen could hold so much personality, so much kindness, and so much of my heart. Even though I can’t reach out and grab your hand right now, I feel you with me.❤️<br>
                Distance is just a number, but what we have is a vibe that most people don't find even when they’re standing right next to each other. ❤️<br>
                And you know what you’re the only person who truly gets me. I might not be able to steal your hoodies yet, but I’ve already stolen your heart (no refunds, sorry).😁❤️<br>
                I Love you to the moon and back ❤️.<br><br>
                Forever yours,<br>
                Hanshika ❤️
